# 2️⃣ step 2 - Backup Your Game Files

Backup Your Game Files 💾

Modifying the game files always carries a risk of corrupting your game files or even save files. To ensure that you can restore your game to its original state if something goes wrong make sure you do a backup.

* Press Win + R on your keyboard to open the Run window.
* &#x20;Input %AppData% to the text box and press Enter to open the Roaming folder.&#x20;
* Go to 7DaysToDie > Saves and then you can find the save files.

presonally i would just copy the whole 7daystodie folder just to be extra safe&#x20;
